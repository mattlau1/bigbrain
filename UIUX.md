# Describe any attempts you've made to improve the UI/UX or Accessibility in `UIUX.md`
## UI/UX
- Alerts & notifications are always in the same spot
- Users are always notified if something happens
- Users can't get stuck as navbar is on every page
- Admin dashboard is completely usable without a mouse

## Accessibility
- Consistent colour scheme across the entire web app
- High contrast between background colours and font colours for every element
- Easily identifiable links and buttons
- Labelled buttons and input fields
