# Describe any attempts you've made to improve the UI/UX or Accessibility in `UIUX.md`
## UI/UX
- Alerts/notifications are always in the same spot
- All users are always notified if something fails or succeeds
- Admins are easily able to navigate back to the dashboard from any admin page through the navbar
- Admin dashboard is completely usable without a mouse
- App is mobile friendly
- App uses grid system to ensure that content is near the center of the screen

## Accessibility
- Consistent colour scheme across the entire web app
- Good amount of contrast between background and font colour for every element
- Links and buttons are easily identifiable
- Buttons and input fields have labels and/or placeholders
- All images have an alt text
